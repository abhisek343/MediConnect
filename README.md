# Medi Connect

## Abstract
In the e-healthcare system, patients can enjoy high-quality medical services by sharing encrypted personal healthcare records (PHRs) with doctors or medical research institutions. However, encrypted PHRs often hinder effective information search, leading to decreased data usage. Additionally, the requirement for doctors to be online constantly during the medical treatment process can be burdensome and impractical. In this project, we propose Medi Connect, a new secure and practical proxy searchable re-encryption scheme. This scheme enables medical service providers to achieve remote PHRs monitoring and research safely and efficiently. Key features include:

1. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Patients' healthcare records collected by devices are encrypted before uploading to the cloud server, ensuring privacy and confidentiality of PHRs.
2. **Access Control**: Only authorized doctors or research institutions have access to the PHRs.
3. **Delegation of Authority**: Doctor-in-charge can delegate medical research and utilization to doctor-in-agent or certain research institutions through the cloud server, minimizing information exposure to the cloud server.

We formalize the security definition and prove the security of our scheme. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our solution.
